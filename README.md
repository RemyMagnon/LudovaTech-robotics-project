# LudovaTech-robotics-project

This is the robotics project I worked on in high school as captain of the robotics team. It consists of building two small autonomous robots designed to play soccer against another team of two robots.

[Video demonstration](https://youtu.be/_eiEAFdv0b4?si=FcbZjqLqs41bY-pg) of how the robot works.  
Additional videos available on the [LudovaTech YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@LudovaTech).
